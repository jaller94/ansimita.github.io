    <h1>Move to Sweden?</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I've been stuck in a city for far too long.</p>
    <h2>Perks</h2>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>I love Swedish architecture. Read about the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architecture_of_sweden">Architecture of Sweden</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>As someone pursuing a career in technology, Sweden is highly ranked in various innovation surveys:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/facts-figures/scoreboards_en">European Innovation Scoreboard</a></li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/home">Global Innovation Index</a></li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.prosperity.com/rankings">Legatum Prosperity Index</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nordic Model</h3>
    <p>Read about the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model">Nordic Model</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
    <h3>Scandinavian Design</h3>
    <p>Read about the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_design">Scandinavian Design</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
    <h3>Schengen Area</h3>
    <p>From the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area">Schengen Area</a> entry on Wikipedia:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Schengen Area is an area comprising 26 European countries that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. the area mostly functions as a single jurisdiction for international travel purposes, with a common visa policy.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Swedish</h3>
    <p>I took two introductory courses to Swedish during my undergraduate studies. Every opportunity I had to communicate in Swedish when I visited Sweden had me feeling like I had a superpower!</p>
    <p>Furthermore, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sayitinswe/status/1284949057333391360">Say it in Swedish</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Swedish, Norwegian and Danish are mutually intelligible to different degrees and depending on dialects. but you probably already knew that.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
    <h3>Housing Crisis</h3>
    <p>Read &quot;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelocal.se/20170828/the-story-of-swedens-housing-crisis">The Story of Sweden's Housing Crisis</a>&quot; by The Local Sweden.</p>
    <p>Counterargument: Which large city is without a housing issue?</p>
    <h3>Opinion Corridor</h3>
    <p>In &quot;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/26/swedish-exceptionalism-coronavirus-covid19-death-toll">Swedish exceptionalism has been ended by coronavirus</a>&quot; by Erik Augustin Palm:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The idea of the &quot;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_corridor">opinion corridor</a>&quot;, which has become infamous in the discussion around Sweden, helps illuminate why the country's Covid-19 debate has been so flawed. It refers to the narrow range of opinions deemed appropriate in Swedish media. Although not entirely different to other concepts on discourse parameters, the opinion corridor is a particular product of Sweden's attachment to consensus building. Ask any expat there and they'll tell you how committed Swedes are to this as an end in itself. They will probably also tell you that going against the grain in Sweden can have real consequences, whether it be social or career costs.</p>
